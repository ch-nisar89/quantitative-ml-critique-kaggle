# 🧠 ML Notebook Critiques 

This repository contains a structured academic critique of **three Kaggle notebooks**, completed as part of MSc coursework at the University of Strathclyde. The task required deconstructing real-world ML notebooks to identify where **quantitative methods** (maths/statistics) were applied or could have been applied.

---

## 🎯 Aim

To demonstrate an appreciation of how quantitative methods are used within the context of AI/ML by deconstructing selected Kaggle notebooks. This was done through:

- Annotating selected notebooks with in-line references and critique tags
- Producing a detailed PDF report referencing specific code lines/cells
- Evaluating objectives, method use, limitations, and alternative techniques
